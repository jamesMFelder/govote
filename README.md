# Govote
An app that reminds you to vote.<br />
Eventually, users will submit dates that will be verified, but to get this off the ground, I am using https://www.usvotefoundation.org/ to source the dates.
### Users
- To use(when it is ready), pull from the stable branch.
### Developers
- Any and all help is appriciated.
- I only have a Linux machine to test this on, so other people will need to test the Windows and Mac OS clients(not that I don't need other people to test the Linux client).
- To develop, fork the testing branch, do your edit(s), and create a pull request.
- Please try to keep pull requests small enough to do a carefull review of.
- The goal is for the clients to all have the same features, simplifying maintainance and compatability with the server.
